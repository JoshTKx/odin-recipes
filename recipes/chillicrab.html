    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
        Chili crab was created in Singapore in the 1950s by Cher Yam Tian. After experimenting in her kitchen for family and friends, her crabs became a hit, and her family opened their first restaurant, Palm Beach Seafood. Since then, the dish has become a staple on menus across Singapore, from hawker centers to fancy restaurants.
        Crabs are served in a huge puddle of tomato sauce that's sweet, spicy, tangy, and often thickened with egg.
