    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Bak Kut Teh in the Hokkien or Fujianese dialect literally translates to Pork Rib Tea. This rich herbal soup contains dong gui (Angelica Sinensis), known for its warming properties. For this reason, it is popularly eaten as a supper or late night meal in Malaysia and Singapore.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2> 
    <ul>
        <li>1 whole rack of spare ribs</li>
        <li>3 tbsp white peppercorns</li>
        <li>3 star anise</li>
        <li>cinnamon</li>
        <li>15 cloves of garlic</li>
        <li>225g tofu puffs</li>
        <li>2tbsp light soy sauce</li>
        <li>2tbsp firsh sauce</li>
        <li>chillies</li>
        <li>light soy sauce</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Coarsely grind the black and white peppercorns in a pestle and mortar or spice grinder. Place the ground pepper on top of a clean moulin with the star anise and cinnamon and tie it really tightly so that the spices canâ€™t escape. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Cover the pork ribs and pork belly in a large saucepan with water and bring to a boil over high heat. After 10 minutes of boiling, strain the pork into a colander and wash off any blood or impurities.
        </li>
        <li>Wipe the pot clean and return the pork with 2 1/2 litres (10 cups) water to the pot and place over high heat. Bring to a simmer and reduce the heat some to simmer lightly for 10 minutes. Scoop off any foam that rises to the top.</li>
        <li>Place the spices in the pot along with the garlic and simmer lightly , covered for 30 minutes. Then stir in the dried shitake mushrooms and tofu puffs and continue simmering, covered for about 30 to 45 more minutes or until the pork is really tender.</li>
        <li>Add the soy sauce and fish sauce. I suggest adding these to taste. Divide between 4 soup bowls. If you want to eat this hakken style, be sure to serve it with lots of white rice and chilli soy sauce.
        </li>
        <li>To make the chilli soy sauce, simply pour some light soy sauce into 4 small dipping bowls and add finely chopped red chillies to taste to each.</li>

    </ol>
